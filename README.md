# Mod20_Segment_2
By the end of this segment, we will have made great strides in building the different pieces of the project. The analysis is coming along, work on your machine learning model has commenced, and the database will be transitioned into an operational, data-holding tool.

# Purpose

Second Segment: Build the Pieces:Â Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.

# Presentation 

From Segment 1;
* Selected topic:
* Reason we selected the topic:
* Description of the source of data:
* Questions we hope to answer with the data:

From Segment 2;
* Description of the data exploration phase of the project
* Description of the analysis phase of the project

Slides in Google Slides

# Github 

* All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
* Some code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of project
* Description of the communication protocols
* Outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)

* Individual Branches:
There is one branch for each team member as follows:
![D2b](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_1/blob/main/Pictures/D2b.PNG)

* Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the first segment:

# Machine Learning Model

Code for the machine learning model, as well as the following:
* Description of preliminary data preprocessing
* Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including the decision-making process
* Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
* Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits


# Database 

Present a fully integrated database, including the following:
* Database stores static data for use during the project
* Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database)
* Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
* Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
* Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

# Technologies Used

* Which tools are the best fit for your project? 
* What will be used for each section? 
* For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.  
* How will the dashboard be built? 

# Dashboard

A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:
* Storyboard on a Google Slide(s)
* Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create the final dashboard
* Description of interactive element(s)

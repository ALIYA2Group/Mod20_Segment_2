# Mod20_Segment_2
By the end of this segment, we will have made great strides in building the different pieces of the project. The analysis is coming along, work on your machine learning model has commenced, and the database will be transitioned into an operational, data-holding tool.

# Purpose

Second Segment: Build the Pieces: Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.

# Presentation 

* Description of the data exploration phase of the project

Hypothesis: If Polar Sea Ice Extent is related to feature properties in table, then changes in the daily/month data will be reducing from time and feature property.  
The null hypothesis (Ho) is also known as H0 and is generally the hypothesis that can be explained by random chance.
The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is also known as Ha and is generally the hypothesis that is influenced by non-random events.
Ho : PH = 0.5
Ha : PH ≠ 0.5



* Description of the analysis phase of the project
* If you had more time, where would you like to investigate for finer tuning? 
* How does it work?
* Why this specific model?
* What is the model's accuracy?
* If there are statistics involved, what stats are being included in analysis and why?
* If no statistics are involved, what would you include if you had more time?
* have a description of the model and a discussion about any preprocessing involved. Additionally, an interpretation of the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the model should be included with the submission.

# Github 

* All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
* Some code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of project
* Description of the communication protocols
* Outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)

* Individual Branches:
There is one branch for each team member as follows:
![D2b](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_1/blob/main/Pictures/D2b.PNG)

* Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the first segment:

# Machine Learning Model

Code for the machine learning model, as well as the following:
* Description of preliminary data preprocessing
* Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including the decision-making process
* Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
* Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits


# Database 

Present a fully integrated database, including the following:
* Database stores static data for use during the project
* Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database)
* Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
* Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
* Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

# Technologies Used

* Which tools are the best fit for your project? 
* What will be used for each section? 
* For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.  
* How will the dashboard be built? 

# Dashboard

A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:
* Storyboard on a Google Slide(s)
* Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create the final dashboard
* Description of interactive element(s)
